# Sugar free fudge

* Recipe found originally [here](https://thesugarfreediva.com/fabulous-sugar-free-fudge/) - thanks Bruce :)

## Ingredients

* 3 8oz bags Sugar Free Chocolate Chips
* 1/2 cup Evaporated Milk
* 1 cup Granular Sugar Alternative Use granular alternative that is 1:1 to sugar
* 1/2 cup Butter
* 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract

## Instructions

1. This recipe calls for the use of a microwave. However, you could make this on the stove using a double boiler or similar method. Also, you will need a large microwave-safe bowl for cooking this as well.

2. Prepare a square glass baking dish with aluminum foil which also overlaps the sides of the dish. Grease or spray this lined baking dish to prevent sticking as well. You can set this aside.

3. I like to start by spraying my bowl with nonstick before cooking in it. Place the chocolate chips into the bowl and cook for 30 seconds on medium. Covering the bowl loosely with a microwave safe paper towel can help prevent a possible mess (at least in my kitchen). Stir in the evaporated milks and then the sugar alternative, butter and vanilla. Cook for another 30 seconds and stir again. Continue this process until everything has melted and blended together- about 4- 4 1/2 minutes total.

4. Obviously this will be hot so please take precautions. Remove the bowl from the microwave and pour the fudge into the prepped baking dish. Allow to cool at room temperature. Then refrigerate your fudge until you are ready to cut it into squares.
