# Da Mama's Apricot Bars

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
* 1 cup brown sugar  (firmly packed)
* 3/4 cup butter or margarine
* 3/4 cup apricot preserves or jam (I use more to cover the layer.)

## Instructions
1. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in rolled oats and brown sugar.
Cut in (with pastry blender or fork or two knives) butter until crumbly.
Pat 2/3 of crumb mixture into bottom of 11x7x1 1/2 inch pan.
Spread with preserves. Cover with remaining crumb mixture.

2. Bake at  375 degrees about 35 minutes or until browned.  Cool.
Cut ionto bars or squares.

***
I bake them in the microwave at 70 percent (medium high) for 8 to 9 minutes.
Even in the microwave I add a small piece of foil over  the corners to keep them from
   becoming hard.
