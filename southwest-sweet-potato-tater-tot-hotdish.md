## Description
This sweet potato tater tot hotdish is a spicy twist on the original – loaded with peppers, corn, black beans, homemade queso sauce, and tots! YUM!

# Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 red/yellow bell peppers, chopped
* 2 poblano peppers, chopped
* 16 ounces fresh mushrooms, stems removed, chopped
* 1 tablespoon cumin
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1/4 cup flour
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1 pound pepperjack cheese, cut into cubes
* 1 14-ounce can black beans
* 1 cup frozen corn
* salt to taste
* 1–2 bags sweet potato tater tots
* red peppers, corn, cilantro, jalapeño for topping

## Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

2. Heat the butter over medium high heat in a 10.25-inch cast iron skillet. Add the onion, garlic, mushrooms, and peppers; saute until soft. Add the spices and stir to mix.
3. Add the flour and stir to coat until everything gets sticky. Add the milk slowly, stirring after each addition, until you get a smooth mixture. Add the cheese cubes and stir until melted.
4. Stir in the black beans and corn. Taste and adjust – this is a good time to add your salt!
5. Top the whole thing with tater tots (I did mine in a circle formation).
6. Bake for 20-30 minutes. BEWARE THE BUBBLING OVER – put a pan underneath to catch any drips. Let stand for a few minutes before serving.
